**Mission:** Get Shane the reoccuring Ca$h money he deserves from his service to the United Fucking States of Gawd Damn America!
**How:** Get Shane to the TX Vet commision to have them do this on his behalf for fucking free
**Why:** Long term financial security. Whatever ratig you get, you get money for you, your wife, and each kid. So, each month you hold off on this you're leaving 1 - 2000 dollars on the table tax fee and saying no thanks. That's okay though because the Catch me outside girl is a millionaire. 

+ **What needs to happen (really, what Justin would do)**: 
  - find your VA binder and put it in a consistent place
  - set a goal of when you're going to have the claim submitted by (doesnt matter if someone else shoots it down, just need to have an obtainable goal)
  - Let your boss know that you're trying to get your VA claim done so you can get some cash. let him know ahead of time that there may be some appointments. 
  - When you have 10 - 15 minutes, call the location where you would like to make an apointment.
    - Explain that you need to schedule a call to get your claim going.
    - Mention the way your work schedule is and ask how they can fit you in
    - Ask for a list of any paperwork that is needed prior the the apointment. See if they can email that to you. 
    - When you have an apointment set, make sure to let your boss know as well so the time is blocked out. take time off if you need to. The hour of PTO is nothing compared to any money coming in month over month the rest of your life
  - When you have your apointment on the phone the TX vet rep should be able to help you get this all sorted out. 
  - TX vet commision is FREE and doesn't take any of your stuff. Most of the people there are retired military. they exist to help you in this. 
  
+ **What to do after you set up an apointment and file the paperwork with the VA:**
  - keep all VA communication letters in one place (binder)
  - when you get your apointment location, look it up in advance ( I know you know this town better than I do for sure so this may not be needed)
  - be at least 15 minutes early to the apointment. 
  - answer the questions as needed. Stuff we've discussed before:
  - Issues:
    - Anxiety / PTSD 
     - This is the chart they use for different criteri:
